Uses DC Generative Adversial Networks and VAE and a combined approach
# **Human Face Generation Model**

### **Project Overview**
The **Human Face Generation Model** leverages deep learning techniques to generate realistic human face images. This project utilizes two popular generative models—**DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)** and **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**—and also explores a **combined approach** to improve the quality of generated faces. The model is trained on a dataset of real human faces and can synthesize new faces based on learned patterns.

### **Installation**

#### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-face-generator.git
cd human-face-generator

Environment Setup
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
Install Required Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Dataset:
Place the human face images you want to use for training in the dataset/ folder.

Training the Model:
To train the model using DCGAN, VAE, or the combined approach, run the following commands:

Train DCGAN:

python train.py --model dcgan --data_path ./dataset --epochs 1000 --batch_size 128
Train VAE:

python train.py --model vae --data_path ./dataset --epochs 1000 --batch_size 128
Train Combined Model:

python train.py --model combined --data_path ./dataset --epochs 1000 --batch_size 128
You can specify additional parameters such as:

--epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 1000).
--batch_size: Batch size for training (default: 128).
--save_interval: Interval (in epochs) to save generated faces (default: 50).
Generate Faces:
After training, you can generate human face images by running:

python generate.py --model dcgan --model_path ./saved_models/dcgan_generator.h5 --num_images 10
For VAE or combined approach, use the appropriate model name in place of dcgan.

Visualize Results:
Generated face images are saved in the output/ folder after each training interval and at the end of training.

Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of real human face images. You can download datasets like CelebA or FFHQ, or use your custom dataset.
The dataset should be structured as follows:
dataset/
├── face1.png
├── face2.png
└── ...
Model Architecture
1. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
DCGAN is a type of GAN that uses deep convolutional networks for both the Generator and Discriminator. It is particularly effective for image generation tasks:

Generator: Takes random noise as input and outputs realistic face images using transposed convolution layers.
Discriminator: Classifies images as real or fake using standard convolution layers, aiming to distinguish between generated and real faces.
2. VAE (Variational Autoencoder)
VAE is a generative model that learns a probabilistic latent space of data:

Encoder: Maps input face images to a latent space distribution.
Decoder: Samples from this distribution and reconstructs face images from the latent vectors.
3. Combined Approach
This approach merges the power of both DCGAN and VAE:

The VAE is used to generate a latent vector, which is then passed to the DCGAN Generator for face generation. The combined model aims to improve the diversity and quality of generated faces by incorporating the strengths of both architectures.
Training
The training process alternates between updating the Generator and Discriminator in DCGAN or optimizing the Encoder and Decoder in VAE.

Use the following command to start training with your preferred model:

python train.py --model {dcgan/vae/combined} --data_path ./dataset --epochs 1000 --batch_size 128
The training progress is saved periodically, including model weights (saved_models/) and generated faces (output/).

Results
Generated faces are saved during training and at the end of each training session.
Example results can be found in the output/ folder.
You can generate new faces from a trained model using the following command:
python generate.py --model {dcgan/vae/combined} --model_path ./saved_models/model_name.h5 --num_images 10
The quality of the generated faces will improve as training progresses, and the combined model may yield more diverse and higher-quality faces than standalone models.

Future Improvements
Model Refinement: Explore more advanced architectures like StyleGAN or ProGAN for enhanced face generation.
Data Augmentation: Use data augmentation techniques to increase the variety and robustness of the training dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, latent vector sizes, and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Pretrained Models: Incorporate transfer learning with pre-trained models to accelerate training and improve results.
